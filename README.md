## Case Study on Heart Failure Dataset
This case study involves analyzing the heart failure dataset obtained from Kaggle. We employed five different models to evaluate their accuracy in predicting outcomes:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)


##### Among these, the Support Vector Machine model demonstrated the highest accuracy.
